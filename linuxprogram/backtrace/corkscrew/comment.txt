1. gcc compiles failed as follow, need to link stdc++ by -lstdc++. g++ doesn`t do this.
    /tmp/ccd2btTo.o:(.eh_frame+0x13): undefined reference to `__gxx_personality_v0'
    collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

2. there are some errors when compile with -lstdc++, need to apt-get install 32bit`s stdc++ lib by g++-multilib
    /usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.6/libstdc++.so when searching for -lstdc++
    /usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.6/libstdc++.a when searching for -lstdc++
    /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lstdc++
    collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

4. auto variable for make
    $+($^):
    $<:
    $@:
