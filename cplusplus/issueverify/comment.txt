1. the difference between #include <iostream> and #include <iostream>
    iostream is c++ standard(need std namespace), but iostream.h is nonstandard.
    note: private header file need the full name.

2. namespace is not same as class name.
    PreProcessor.cpp:10:5: error: reference to ‘TestPreProcessor’ is ambiguous
    PreProcessor.h:8:28: error: candidates are: namespace TestPreProcessor { }
    PreProcessor.h:11:7: error: class TestPreProcessor::TestPreProcessor

3. the difference of class member variable and class member function
    the class member function is only one, all objects share it.
    but the class member variable is respective for each object.
